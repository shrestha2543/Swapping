# Swapping
Swapping of any two numbers:
This involves three steps:-
Step 1: Taking input of any two numbers a and b
Step 2: Finding the sum of the two numbers and storing them in variable c
Step 3: Subtracting b from c (which will give us a) and storing it in variable b
Step 4: Now, the value of b has been updated and is equal to a
Step 5: Subtracting b from c (which will give us previous value of b) and storing it in variable a
Step 6: Printing the final values of a and b
